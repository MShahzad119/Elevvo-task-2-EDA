# 🚀 Task 2 of My Internship at Elevvo Pathways — Titanic EDA 🚀  

As part of my internship journey with **Elevvo Pathways**, I completed **Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** dataset (Kaggle).  

---

## 🔹 Key Steps in My Analysis  
- **Data Cleaning** → handled missing values in *Age*, *Embarked*, and *Fare*  
- **Type Conversion** → ensured columns like *Survived* were numeric to avoid errors/warnings  
- **Group-Based Insights** → analyzed survival rates by gender, passenger class, and embarkation port  
- **Visualization** → plotted survival patterns and correlations for better storytelling  

---

## 📊 Interesting Findings  
- 👩 **Women had a much higher survival rate than men**  
- 🎟️ **1st-class passengers were more likely to survive**  
- 🚢 **Passengers embarking from 'C' port had slightly higher survival odds**

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas 📑  
- Seaborn 🎨  
- Matplotlib 📊  

---

## 💡 Learning Outcome  
This task not only improved my **technical skills** but also gave me a deeper appreciation for how **cleaning & preparing data** is just as important as **modeling** it.
